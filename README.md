Sharks VS Jets: Fingeance

## Members
Michael Delfino, Donnie Lytle, Nathan Turner

## Description
You are a shark striking from *beneath the surface*  
to get your **fingeance** on the Jets for moving in on your surf.

## Building from source
This project has been reworked to take advantage of the
[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman)
[Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
[generator](https://github.com/codevinsky/generator-phaser-official). 

As such, it uses [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) to manage
its dependencies and [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) to build.  
### Steps to build:
- bower install  
- sudo npm install  
- grunt
